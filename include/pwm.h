 * @brief Headers stabilishing the API galileo's PWM.
 * 
 * Interfaces with the /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm1 channel.
 * The frequency must be set with the setup() function, with a given starting duty cycle.
 * The frequency ranges from 24Hz to 1525Hz.
 * The duty cycle may be update with the dutyCycle() function. 
 * Further details about the dutyCycle are specified in the ducyCycle().
 * When done, teardown() should be called in order to correctly disable the PWM.
